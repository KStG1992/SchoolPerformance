    "1. The Top 5 Performing Schools by % Overall Passing are all Charter Schools. Whereas the Bottom 5 Performing Schools by % Overall Passing are all District Schools. It should be noted that this trend is not related to each school's Budget Per Student. For example, the Top 5 Performing Schools by % Overall Passing have a Budget Per Student ranging from `$578` to `$638`. In contrast, the Bottom 5 have a Budget Per Student ranging from `$637` to `$655`. The data would suggest that Overall Performance has to do with the size of the school. The Top 5 Schools have a size ranging from `962` to `2283`. Whereas the Bottom 5 Schools have a size ranging from `2917` to `4761`. In summary, the Top 5 Performing Schools are Charter Schools, most likely due to the school size.\n",
